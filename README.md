ðŸš§ Dataset Under Active Curation â€“ Sample Release Only

This repository is currently under active curation. We are incrementally cleaning, validating, and enriching the data to ensure the highest possible quality and usability. At this stage, we are releasing only a limited set of representative samples to give the community an early look at the datasetâ€™s structure and content. These samples are intentionally partialâ€”some annotations, metadata, or auxiliary files may still be missingâ€”and they may evolve in both format and detail as we continue our work.

We welcome early feedback, bug reports, and suggestions via GitHub Issues. Once the full-scale dataset has completed our rigorous review pipeline, we will publish the complete version together with comprehensive documentation, usage guidelines, and benchmark results. Stay tuned for upcoming releases, and thank you for your patience and interest!
